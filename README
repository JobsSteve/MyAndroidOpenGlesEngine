This is a simple, bare bones, Android native OpenGL ES 1.0 project.

I'm learning OpenglES recently and have searched some tutorials and 
in this project some codes are from that tutorials ;)

For now I have not enough much time to learn it so I open source it and 
will continue coding it whenever I have extra time.

And I hope anyone who is familiar with OpenGLES can contribute it,  that would be
very appreciated.
